\usage{
loco(
  .data,
  x,
  y,
  timestamp = NULL,
  demean = TRUE,
  window_size,
  decay = 0.95,
  exp_window = TRUE,
  k
)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A data frame or a data frame extension (e.g. a tibble).}

\item{x, y}{Names of the columns containing the time series data, as symbols.}

\item{timestamp}{An optional parameter specifying the name of the column, as a symbol,
containing timestamps corresponding to \code{x} and \code{y}.}

\item{demean}{Subtract the series' respective means from the time series values. Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{window_size}{The size of the window to use when calculating autocovariances.}

\item{decay}{The exponential decay factor used to downweight historic time windows when using an
exponential sliding window. Should be a value strictly between 0 (most decay) and 1
(least decay). Ignored if \code{exp_window} is FALSE.}

\item{exp_window}{Should an exponential sliding window be used? Defaults to TRUE. If FALSE, a
sliding (a.k.a. boxcar) window is used.}

\item{k}{The number of principal eigenvectors to consider when calculating the LoCo scores.
Value should be an integer between 1 and \code{window_size}.}
}
\value{
A \link[tibble:tibble-package]{tibble} with columns \code{timestamp} (if supplied) and \code{score}.
}
\description{
Calculate local correlation (LoCo) scores for a pair of time series.
}
\details{
The LoCo score is an extension of the linear cross-correlation coefficient and measures the local
similarity (concurrent alignment) between two time series using the spectral decompositions of
local autocovariance matrices. The LoCo score is a value between 0 (weak alignment) and 1
(strong alignment).
